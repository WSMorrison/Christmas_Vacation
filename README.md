Bug caused the game_over_lose() function to print "You lose" once for every time the dice_roll() function was called. Troubleshooting found I used an if statement instead of an elif statement for the losing condition, which apparently holds all of the print() commands until it's finally called. Replaced with an elif, problem solved.
